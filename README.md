# FlameCore Incubator

This repository acts as a central place for all FlameCore projects that are in an early stage of development.

Once a component reaches sufficient maturity, it will be moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/flamecore)
and composer package, and enter a beta phase. For this reason, this repository will never contain releases.

Feel free to use the incubator for your own use/research, but please note that the API can, and will,
change at any time. Components can also disappear at any time.


## Security

If you discover any security related issues, please email <security@flamecore.org> instead of using the issue tracker.
