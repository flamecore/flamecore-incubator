# FlameCore Incubator

This repository acts as a central place for all FlameCore projects that are in an early stage of development.

Once a component reaches sufficient maturity, it will be moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/flamecore)
and composer package, and enter a beta phase. For this reason, this repository will never contain releases.

Feel free to use the incubator for your own use/research, but please note that **the API can, and will, change at any time.
Components can also disappear at any time.**


## Installation

The incubator projects can be included in your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

### Install via Composer

[Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) if you don't already have it present on your system.

To install the library, run the following commands and you will get the latest version:

    $ composer require flamecore/incubator:dev-main


## Documentation

If you need any help with a component, please refer to the respective README file in the component's directory.


## Security

If you discover any security related issues, please email <security@flamecore.org> instead of using the issue tracker.
